          <li>All announcements will be sent via the course mailing list.
          Students are responsible for reading each email announcement in
          detail.  </li>

          <li>The first assignment submission should be done through
          Oncourse. Make sure that the assignments are properly submitted
          because Oncourse sometimes fails to receive your assignments. You are
          responsible for ensuring the submission except in rare circumstances
          of system failure. </li>

        <li>The programming assignments and final project submission should be done through
          github.iu or hackerrank website. </li>
          
          <li>Assignments will be accepted up to 48 hours after the due date, but a 10% late penalty will be assessed;
assignments received more than 48 hours late will not be accepted and will receive a failing grade..
          </li>
          
          <li>Please contact the instructor if you have a <a
            href="http://studentaffairs.iub.edu/dss/">disability that require
            some arrangements</a>, or any other constraints that affect you, so
            that appropriate arrangements can be made.  </li>
          
          <li> Please contact the instructor if you need an accomodation regarding to the religious holidays by the end of 
          the end of the second week of the semester. Instructors are expected to give students the opportunity to do 
          appropriate make-up work that is intrinsically no more difficult than the original exam or assignment. (Source:
