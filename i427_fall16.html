This is a course about the techniques and tools that are used to automatically crawl, parse, index, store, rank, and search the Web for information.
By the end of this course, students will have implemented a complete (but simplified) Web search engine. Specific topics will include:
       <ul>
         <li> Python for information retrival. </li>
         <li> Vector space model and similarity measures</li>
          <li> Web crawling</li>
          <li> Indexing </li>
          <li> Retrieval and Ranking</li>
          <li> Link analysis and PageRank </li>
          <li>Search and query interfaces </li>
          <li>Search engine optimization </li>
          <li>Ethical and legal implications of search</li>

          <li>Students are responsible for their assignment submissions.
		   Students must ensure a timely and complete submission through IU Canvas. </li>

assignments that are received more than 48 hours late will not be accepted and will receive a failing grade.

          <li> Please contact the instructor if you need an accomodation regarding to the religious holidays by the end of 
          the second week of the semester. Instructors are expected to give students the opportunity to do 
          appropriate make-up work that is intrinsically no more difficult than the original exam or assignment. (Source:
