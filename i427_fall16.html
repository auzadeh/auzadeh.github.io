This is a course about the techniques and tools used to automatically crawl, parse, index, store, rank, and search Web information.
By the end of the course, students will have implemented a complete (but simplified) web search engine. Specific topics will include:
       <ul>
         <li> Python to do data mining and information retrival. </li>
         <li> Vector Space Model and similarity measures</li>
          <li> Web Crawling</li>
          <li> Indexing </li>
          <li> Ranking</li>
          <li>Search and query interfaces </li>
          <li>Search Engine Optimization </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Class policies</h2>
        <ul>

          <li>All announcements will be sent via the course mailing list.
          Students are responsible for reading each email announcement in
          detail.  </li>

          <li>Please contact the instructor if you have a <a
            href="http://studentaffairs.iub.edu/dss/">disability that require
            some arrangements</a>, or any other constraints that affect you, so
          that appropriate arrangements can be made.  </li>

          <li>The first assignment submission should be done through
          Oncourse. Make sure that the assignments are properly submitted
          because Oncourse sometimes fails to receive your assignments. You are
          responsible for ensuring the submission except in rare circumstances
          of system failure. </li>

        <li>The programming assignments and final project submission should be done through
          github.iu or hackerrank website. </li>
          
          <li>Late assignments: <strong>start early!</strong> Assignments will be accepted up to 48 hours after the due date, but a 10% late penalty will be assessed;
assignments received more than 48 hours late will not be accepted and will receive a failing grade..
          </li>

        </ul>

        <h2><a name="project">Final Projects (Due 12/14)</a></h2>

        The aim of the final project is synthesizing various aspects of
        information infrastructure that you have been studying throughout the
        course to build an actual system that <em>gather, store, process, and
          serve</em> information and data. You can do either a standard project
        or a challenge projet. 

        <dl>
          <dt>Standard project</dt>

          <dd>You will build a complete web search engine and an accompanying report. </dd>

        </dl>

        There will be extra credits for incorporating extra elements in any
        aspect of the system. Some examples: 

        <h2>Academic integrity</h2> 

        The principles of academic honesty and ethics will be enforced. Any
        cases of academic misconduct (cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, etc)
        will be thoroughly investigated and immediately reported to the School
        and the Dean of Students. 

        You should actively discuss with others, but you should write your own
        code (report). Credit all the sources (discussion with other students,
        used softwares, etc). 

        <ul>

            Responsibilities, and Conduct</a></li> 
        </ul>

        <h2>Grading policy</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Lab assignments 10%</li>
          <li> Calss pop quizzes 20%</li>
          <li> Assignments: 40% </li>
          <li> Final project: 30% </li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <p>pop quizzes will consist of multiple-choice and short answer
        questions and they will be about course material we covered and lab
        assignments. </p>

        <p>You will get an F grade if you fail to submit the final project. </p>
